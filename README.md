###3. Description
In this little project , I achieved a effect of turning over playing cards , which is based on a GridView.  items of ths GridView can flip with a rotate animation such as turning over cards. what's more, when u shake your device the picture in item will be changed.
The Rotate function in my project refer to [**3DNumberRotate**](https://github.com/jianghejie/3DNumberRotate) created by jianghejie, it very nice! thank you! Besides, I used **universal-image-loader** to download online pictures.
